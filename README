Dibrawi: The Distributed Bracetax Wiki


Status: Still Under Heavy Development
- only command line access (no web editing)
- anything is subject to change at some point
- there is extremely little documentation

Installation:

  * Dibrawi is written in OCaml, and is built with OASIS/OCamlbuild.
    It uses the following libraries:
      sebib
      bracetax
      unix
      extlib
      pcre
      xml-light
      sexplib
    And full usage of it will require at run-time:
      TeXLive
      Camlmix
      Inkscape
      Graphviz
  
  * To build:
    oasis setup
    ocaml setup.ml -configure --prefix /some/cool/place/like/usr
    make
    make install


Basic Usage:

  If you have a directory tree `data/...' with a bunch of .brtx files,
  you may run:
      dbw wiki -persist-with _build/dbw_persistance \
          -named-template three_columns_greenish-linked \
          data/ _build/
  
  In _build/ you'll have a nice bunch of HTML files with a pretty
  template.
  
  The file _build/dbw_persistance stores information, if you run the
  same command again, only the files that have actually changed will
  be `recompiled'.


  Try also:
      dbw help
