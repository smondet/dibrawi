Dibrawi: The Distributed Bracetax Wiki


Status: Still Under Heavy Development
- only command line access (no web editing)
- anything is subject to change at some point
- there is extremely little documentation

Installation:

  * Dibrawi is written in OCaml, and is built with OCamlfind and
    OMake. It uses the following libraries:
      sebib
      bracetax
      unix
      extlib
      pcre
      xml-light
      sexplib
    And full usage of it will require at run-time:
      TeXLive
      Camlmix
      Inkscape
      Graphviz
  
  * To build, just run omake, the binaries are linked to
      _build/app/dbwpp
      _build/app/dbw
    and to install the `dibrawi' library with ocamlfind, just run:
      omake reinstall_library
    (depending on your setup this might require root priviledges),
    to uninstall the library, you may have guessed:
      omake uninstall_library




Basic Usage:

  If you have a directory tree `data/...' with a bunch of .brtx files,
  you may run:
      dbw  -persist-with _build/dbw_persistance \
          -named-template three_columns_greenish-linked \
          data/ _build/
  
  In _build/ you'll have a nice bunch of HTML files with a pretty
  template.
  
  The file _build/dbw_persistance stores information, if you run the
  same command again, only the files that have actually changed will
  be `recompiled'.
